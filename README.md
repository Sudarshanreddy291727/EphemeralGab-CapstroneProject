# EphemeralGab - Secure online chat application


The project aims to develop a secure online chat application that enables two users to communicate anonymously without storing chat history. Key objectives include:

• User Authentication: Generate and distribute unique connection codes via email or SMS.

• Real-time Communication: Implement WebSocket for instant messaging.

• Ephemeral Messaging: Ensure messages are deleted immediately after the session ends.

• No Data Retention: Guarantee that no chat logs are stored or accessible by the application team.

Expected work products include a fully functional web application, user documentation, and deployment scripts.

 Technologies, Platforms, and Software Tools
• Backend: Python with Flask or FastAPI
• Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (potentially using React or Vue.js)
• Real-time Communication: Flask-SocketIO or WebSockets
• Email/SMS Service: Flask-Mail or Twilio API
